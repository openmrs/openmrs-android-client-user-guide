# Troubleshooting Android Client

#### Can't Login?

There are a few things you would need to first take note in logging in. Make sure that you enter a valid server for the URL address. In setting up a customized server, you may request one from helpdesk or server maintainers. Due to a limitation of resources, do note however that these customized test servers are only meant to be used for a limited time only. For more information regarding different testing servers, please visit the following [link](https://wiki.openmrs.org/display/ISM/OpenMRS+environments). Yould could also revert back of the guide regarding features and using the most common test server on the following [link](https://wiki.openmrs.org/display/ISM/OpenMRS+environments).

Aside from this, do note that the username and password does not correspond to your OpenMRS ID. Commonly, you would opt to use 

username: admin
password: Admin123

if you are using the test server. 

#### Have Another Issue?

This guide covers the basic development setup and things to take note off while using the android client. Make sure the guide first.
