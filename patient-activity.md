# Patient Activity

#### Diagnosis

When viewing a patient, you are able to see illnesses or diseases a patient suffers from. Simply head over to the **Diagnosis** tab to see the patient's list of illnesses or diseases.

#### Visits

A Visit is a time period when a patient is actively interacting with the healthcare system, typically at a location. In most cases with OpenMRS, this is a time when a provider is interacting actively with a patient. Visits are where *encounters* take place; which are used to record a patient's vitals, diagnose a patient and a few other things.

To start a visit to a patient, simply go to the **Visits** tab and click the 'start' button in the action bar. You can see which patients are currently visited by heading to **Active Visits** from home. Now you can choose to end the visit by clicking on the visit, clicking the menu icon and clicking **End Visit**.

#### Vitals

During a visit, you are able to record a patient's vitals (commonly known as biometric data). To capture a vital, simply go to the **Vitals** tab and click on the 'note' icon. From here, you can start to input the patient's biometric data. When done, press the *Submit* button at the bottom. You can also cancel capturing a vital by using your back button or the 'up' icon in the action bar. After submitting a vital, you will see an updated patient vitals form at the vitals tab.

#### Encounters

Encounters usually take place during a visit, however they may also stand alone. Think of an encounter as any collection of data inputted to the EMR system. Generally speaking, every time you enter a form in OpenMRS this creates an **Encounter**.

In the Android client, there is a collection of encounters readily made to input data to patients during their visits. This is done in the **Form Entry** section. To see the process of creating a form (an encounter) in the client, go to the **Form Entry** section from home, then select a patient (preferably a patient on a visit).

Let's create a *Visit Note* form to note down experiences regarding the patient's visit. Answer the questions regarding the patient and click 'Submit' (You will see this form in the patient's visit page later on).

#### Charts

Finally, you may see a graph for patients, measuring height, weight and other observations corresponding to recorded patient vitals in the **Charts** tab.
