### What is OpenMRS?

OpenMRS is a patient-based medical record system focused on giving providers a free, customizable Electronic Medical Record system (EMR).

The mission of OpenMRS is to improve health care delivery in resource-constrained environments by coordinating a global community that creates a robust, scalable, user-driven, open source medical record system platform.

### Motivation for OpenMRS Android Client

In hospitals and clinics there aren’t many computers and most of the work is done manually. It involves a tiresome work to maintain patient records manually.

Market share of Android phones is around 82%. Due to cheap prices and popularity of Android phones, Android apps can be used to do the work easily and efficiently. We can also use some features provided by phones - such as camera, GPS and voice recording - to make the app even more useful. This is also an especially suitable solution for developing countries.

An Android app which functions smoothly, and makes hospital/clinical staffs' work more effective and efficient, is needed. Instead of using a large-sized computer which allows little flexibility, the clinical staff may use Android phones/tablets.
